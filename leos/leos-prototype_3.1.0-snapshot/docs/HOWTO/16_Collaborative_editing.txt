                        COLLABORATIVE EDITING - HOWTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In Leos application, it is possible to edit a document by two or more
   different users simultaneously. One document can be opened by two or more
   users and each user can edit different elements(articles, citations, recitals
   etc.) at the same time. It is not allowed to modify the
   meta-data if there are more than one user working on the document.
   
2. If a user is already working on a document, a user icon will be displayed in 
   the repository browser, below the document icon and on mouse-over, user 
   details will be shown as tool-tip.
   
3. If some users are already working on a document and any user performs any 
   action such as open/edit/save, all users working on same document will 
   gets a notification about action performed in the document viewer.
   
4. Multiple users can edit different elements simultaneously but is not allowed
   to make changes to the structure of the document if the editing is being 
   performed. For e.g. it is not allowed to edit the metadata, table of content 
   or insert and delete an article from the document if any other user has 
   editor open.
   
5. If the editing is not being done, it is allowed to perform the structural 
   changes to the document.
   
6. If one user close the document, the other users gets the notification about 
   it.
