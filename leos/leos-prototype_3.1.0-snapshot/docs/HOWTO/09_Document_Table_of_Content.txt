                        TABLE OF CONTENT - HOWTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. By Default, document viewer is divided into two columns. Left-hand side is
   document area and right-hand side is table of content. The table of content 
   is a tree consists of hierarchical structure of the document. 
   
2. The tool-bar of the table of content consists of three buttons -
      - The expand/collapse button to expand or collapse the tree.
      - The edit button to edit the tree structure.
      - The refresh button to refresh the table of content.
      
3. To edit the table of content, click on the icon with label 'Edit'. A dialog
   will open with title 'Edit table of content'.
   
4. The dialog is divided into 3 parts, left-hand side is the table of content
   displays the document tree, right-hand side consists of the elements that
   can be added to the tree using 'drag n drop' and the bottom area consists of
   meta-data of the selected element in the tree.
   
5. The meta-data section consists of three fields: Type, Number and Heading.
   The 'Heading' field is editable and the rest are read-only. On selection of
   an element from the table of content, these fields are populated. A 'Delete'
   button is also provided to delete an element from the tree if possible.
   
6. New elements can be added to the tree from the right-hand side column using
   'drag n drop'.This feature is bounded by the rules of the document structure,
   so the elements can only be added at a valid level in the hierarchy.
   
7. After the edition, click on the 'Save' button to save the changes. To close
   the dialog click on 'Close', the dialog will be closed and the changes will
   be reflected in the Table of Content and document.
