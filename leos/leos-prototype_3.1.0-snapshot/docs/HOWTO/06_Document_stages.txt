                            DOCUMENT STAGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In LEOS, Document Stage is a property of document which indicates where the 
document stands in  editing process and which all actions are available for the 
document.

There are three stages as of now.
1. IN DRAFTING
	In this stage, a document is being drafted from template. A single or 
	multiple users can work over document. But LEOS is owner system of the 
	document. Here elements can be added, removed, edited. 
2. IN EDITING
	This stage is similar to IN DRAFTING stage with one major difference. At 
	this stage, LEOS is not anymore owner of the document. Mostly, the document 
	is imported from any other collaborating systems and will be exported back 
	to owner system at end of the editing. As of now, integration with other 
	systems is out of scope. So, behaviour is same as that of IN DRAFTING stage.
3. IN REVIEW
	This stage signifies that drafting phase of the document is completed and 
	now document is open to a wider audience for commenting and their reviews on
	different aspects of the document. In this stage, a user can not modify 
	content of the document but only add/edit/delete comment on the different
	sections of the document. Many other functions like editing metadata,
	preview etc. are not available


                            CHANGING STAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	LEOS is not intended to be a workflow system. So stage should not be 
manipulated in LEOS. But for admin purpose, a test functionality is available.

1.	Go to Repository browser and find the document.

2.	Click on stage value which is located on top-right corner of the document 
	card. A drop down will appear.

3.	Select the intended stage and it will result in change in document stage.
