                        MANAGE CONTRIBUTORS - HOWTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The owner/author of a document can choose to share the document with other 
    users who can then view and edit content of the document. These additional 
    users are called contributors in LEOS.

2.  If a user is owner of a document, a 'Contributors' button is available, next
    to the title on document card in the repository browser.  

3.  To add a contributor, click on the 'Contributors' link or small '+' icon. A 
    dialog will open with the list of all available users of the application.
   
3.  Select required users to add as contributors to the document and click 
    'Save'. The users will be added to the list of contributors and will be 
    visible below the 'Contributors' link. Now, this document will be available 
    in repository browser of all the contributors for viewing and editing.
   
4.  To remove an existing contributor, click on the small '-' icon before the
    contributor's name. The user will be removed from the list of contributors 
    of the document and hence will not be able to view or edit the document.
