--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. An additional column can be enabled in document viewer by clicking on
   Menu Bar> Setting menu> "Change ON". On enabling via sub menu, a column 
   appears on left side of document viewer called changes pane. The changes 
   pane contains a tool-bar and document content with highlighted changes. 
      
2. The tool-bar of the changes pane consists of following -
      	- A popup button to select versions to compare. 
	- Navigation buttons to move to previous/next change
      	- Button to reset/hide the changes pane 
      
3. On click of popup button, it opens a window which contains a slider and
   a checkbox. Slider can be used to select versions to show changes between 
   two versions. If the checkbox is selected, it maintains second version at
   latest available version. 

4. When slider is moved and two different versions are selected, the content 
   reflects the changes between two versions. Removed content is marked with red
   and added content is marked with green colour. Changes are also marked on the 
   scroll-bar.

   on 'Next' button scroll the content to next change. Changes can also be 
   navigated through the markers placed on scroll bar.
